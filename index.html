          <span class="image main"><img src="images/Vizag.png" alt=""/></span>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">I come from Visakhaptnam also called as the City of Destiny which is the largest city in the state of Andhra Pradesh in India. I have completed my primary and secondary schooling there.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Ever since, I was a child studying Geography during my schooling, our teacher used to quiz us on places and wanted us to locate them on the world map. Even though it was interesting, I always used to wonder how on earth would people be able to remember all the places on the globe without having a map in hand. It will be a tedious task for people to carry a map to each and every place they go. Then I gradually started thinking, if there could be a better way of searching and travelling places without the need of paper-map. Thats when I got to know about Google Maps in 2005 which initially started as desktop app later emerged as a web-application and the rest is history. I was very fascinated and excited to see them map the entire world in the most accessible format for a layman which made me decide to explore more and pursue a career in this thereby choosing <b><i>Geoinformatics</i></b> as my major for Bachelor's Degree. I was fortunate to know about the beauty of Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and wanted to enhance my knowledge by working, studying, understanding and applying these technologies in wide variety of application areas.

            UTD Bus System is widely used by ton of international students.Since there is no readily available tracking app,students do not get to know how full the bus is before boarding. As a part of this project, an Add-in was developed using ArcObjects and integrated into ArcMap which lets student to select their side (East/West) and also their apartment community, which then highlights the nearest- bustop based on passenger frequency.<br />

            Selecting an area to buy a home is never easy. It takes a lot of planning and preparation.  This project mainly emphasizes on GIS based planning where user-provided criteria rather than the standard criteria listed on real-estate websites for purchasing homes. Data was obtained from Zillow by webscraping using <b><i>soup, urllib & requests python libraries</i></b>. User will be able to provide custom distances for each criteria along with minium & maximum affordable price values which then provides an area satisying the criteria.<br />
